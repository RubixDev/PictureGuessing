Simple party game about quickly guessing images.

Two (or more) teams compete against each other by guessing as many images in one minute as possible. The host can select a folder with images inside. After then starting the game, a random image is chosen and shown covered with purple tiles, which will slowly disappear randomly. If the image was guessed correctly by any team member, the host can either press "Show full Picture" to reveal the full image, or "Go to next Picture" to immediately load the next random image. During that the timer is paused.
After the timer runs out (or all images were guessed), the team gets as many points as they guessed images, and then it's the other teams' turn.
